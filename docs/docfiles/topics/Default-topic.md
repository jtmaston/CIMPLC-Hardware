# Project overview

## About the project
The CIMPLC is a low-cost, open source high pin-count programmable logic controller, designed as a project while
studying at the University of Politehnica, Bucharest. It is designed as a replacement for the aging hardware found
inside the CIM ( Computer Integrated Manufacturing ) located in our faculty.

Designed to replace aging hardware (old Festo PLCs from cca 1993, whose datasheets and manuals are unavailable), the
goal of the CIMPLC is to emulate the functionality of its industrial-grade counterparts, but maintain an accessible
price point. First and foremost, however, it is a learning project, in order to help understand what designing such a
system would entail.

While I took all the necessary precautions to ensure that the device is functional and operational, note that it is a
student project and should absolutely **not** be used in an industrial application. Your mileage may vary. Please see
the "errata" section for errors in the design, and how they were remedied.
