# Version 2

V2 aims to develop on the findings of V1. Development goals are now geared towards a smaller board footprint, and
automated SMT assembly. The power requirements have also been raised, from 500mA per pin to 1A per pin, to accommodate
the measured currents of the motors located in the cell.

I decided to move away from the ESP32 devkit, while maintaining the same ESP-based architecture. This should further be
helpful towards reducing the footprint.

I decided to deprecate dedicated CAN support, as it is less relevant to an industrial application. It will, however, be
kept with traces routed (with DNP on the xciever), in order to account for the possibility of having connections between
PLCs.

I found out that many industrial sensors transmit their data in a current loop, rather than a voltage loop, so I/O
blocks should, in theory, have a mechanism to measure current. The feature is still in development, as it entails
using some resistors that might otherwise interfere with normal operations, but I guess we will see.

Overall pin count was reduced, however I decided to change to a fully symmetric approach, with an equal number of
inputs and outputs. This should double the number of inputs relative to V1, however it reduces the output
count by 8.

This section is highly WIP.
