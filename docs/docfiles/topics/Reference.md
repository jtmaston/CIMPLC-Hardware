# Version 1

This document details specifications and aims to act as sort of spec-sheet for the V1 CIM-PLC. This page may be
incomplete, as it is still incomplete.

V1 of the CIM-PLC is based, as much as possible, on readily-available parts. Since the hardware development time had to 
be reduced as much as possible, it was decided to simplify the control hardware, by using an ESP32 Devkit v4 at the core.
Beyond that, the goal was to employ as many interfaces as possible compatible to the CIM.
